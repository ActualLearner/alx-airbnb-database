#  Performance Monitoring Report

## Commonly Used SQL Queries

Our first step will be the identification of several commonly used queries and using `EXPLAIN` and `ANALYZE` on these queries. This will reveal any performance issues and bottlenecks.

---

#### 1. Find All Properties in a Specific Location Below a Certain Price

```sql
-- Retrieve all properties in 'Downtown' with a price per night under 550
SELECT * 
FROM property
WHERE location = 'Downtown' AND pricepernight < 550;
```

---

#### 2. Retrieve All Bookings with Full Details

```sql
-- Get complete booking information along with payment, property, and user details
SELECT *
FROM payment p
JOIN booking b ON p.booking_id = b.booking_id
JOIN property pr ON b.property_id = pr.property_id
JOIN users u ON u.user_id = b.user_id;
```

---

#### 3. Get Booking with Renter and Host Information

```sql
-- Retrieve booking details along with the renter and host information
SELECT 
    renter.first_name AS renter,
    renter.email AS email,
    hostpr.first_name AS host,
    hostpr.email AS host_email,
    pr.name,
    pr.location
FROM booking bk
JOIN users renter ON bk.user_id = renter.user_id
JOIN property pr ON pr.property_id = bk.property_id
JOIN users hostpr ON pr.host_id = hostpr.user_id;
```

---

#### 4. Get All Reviews for a Specific Property Location

```sql
-- Retrieve all reviews for properties located in 'Downtown'
SELECT 
    pr.name,
    pr.description,
    pr.location,
    pr.pricepernight,
    r.rating
FROM property pr
JOIN review r ON pr.property_id = r.property_id
WHERE pr.location = 'Downtown';
```

---

#### 5. Top-Rated Properties in a Specific Location

```sql
-- List all properties in 'Downtown', sorted by average rating (best-rated first)
SELECT 
    pr.property_id,
    pr.name,
    pr.location,
    pr.pricepernight,
    AVG(r.rating) AS avg_rating
FROM property pr
JOIN review r ON pr.property_id = r.property_id
WHERE pr.location = 'Downtown'
GROUP BY 
    pr.property_id, 
    pr.name, 
    pr.location, 
    pr.pricepernight
ORDER BY avg_rating DESC;
```

---

#### 6. Chat History Between Two Users

```sql
-- Retrieve full chat history (sent and received messages) between two users
SELECT 
    sender.first_name AS sender_name,
    sender.email AS sender_email,
    m.message_body,
    m.sent_at,
    reciever.first_name AS recipient_name,
    reciever.email AS recipient_email
FROM message m
JOIN users sender ON sender.user_id = m.sender_id
JOIN users reciever ON reciever.user_id = m.recipient_id
WHERE (sender_id = @alice_id AND recipient_id = @bob_id) 
   OR (sender_id = @bob_id AND recipient_id = @alice_id);
```


    
## Performance Analysis Results


### 1. Find All Properties in a Specific Location Below a Certain Price

**Before Optimization:**

* Using `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` we obtained the following results:

```
'-> Filter: ((property.location = \'Downtown\') and (property.pricepernight < 550.00))  (cost=2.05 rows=1) (actual time=0.376..0.419 rows=12 loops=1)\n    -> Table scan on property  (cost=2.05 rows=18) (actual time=0.354..0.389 rows=18 loops=1)\n'

```

* Using `SHOW PROFILE` we obtained the following results:

```
starting	0.000576
Executing hook on transaction 	0.000011
starting	0.000021
checking permissions	0.000008
Opening tables	0.000078

waiting for handler commit	0.000012
closing tables	0.000026
freeing items	0.000078
cleaning up	0.001011
```

**Observation:** The `EXPLAIN` plan's **`Table scan on property`** is the clear bottleneck. The database reads every row, which is inefficient. The `SHOW PROFILE` confirms time is spent in the `executing` phase, consistent with row-by-row processing.

**Suggested Optimizations:**
To eliminate the table scan, a composite index on the `WHERE` clause columns is required. `location` should come first as it's used with an equality condition.
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_property_location_price ON property (location, pricepernight);
```

**Results after optimization:**
*   **New `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` Output:**
    ```
    '-> Filter: (property.pricepernight < 550.00)  (cost=0.35 rows=1) (actual time=0.056..0.058 rows=12 loops=1)\n    -> Index range scan on property using idx_property_location_price over (location = \'Downtown\')  (cost=0.35 rows=1) (actual time=0.046..0.049 rows=12 loops=1)\n'
    ```
*   **Improvement:** The slow **`Table scan`** has been successfully replaced by a highly efficient **`Index range scan`**. The database now uses the index as a shortcut to directly access relevant records, significantly reducing query time and improving scalability.

### 2.  Retrieve All Bookings with Full Details

**Before Optimization:**

* Using `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` we obtained the following results:

```
'-> Nested loop inner join  (cost=4.85 rows=4) (actual time=0.125..0.171 rows=4 loops=1)\n    -> Nested loop inner join  (cost=3.45 rows=4) (actual time=0.11..0.144 rows=4 loops=1)\n        -> Nested loop inner join  (cost=2.05 rows=4) (actual time=0.0796..0.0998 rows=4 loops=1)\n            -> Table scan on p  (cost=0.65 rows=4) (actual time=0.0528..0.0582 rows=4 loops=1)\n            -> Single-row index lookup on b using PRIMARY (booking_id=p.booking_id)  (cost=0.275 rows=1) (actual time=0.00962..0.00967 rows=1 loops=4)\n        -> Single-row index lookup on u using PRIMARY (user_id=b.user_id)  (cost=0.275 rows=1) (actual time=0.0106..0.0106 rows=1 loops=4)\n    -> Single-row index lookup on pr using PRIMARY (property_id=b.property_id)  (cost=0.275 rows=1) (actual time=0.00647..0.00653 rows=1 loops=4)\n'

```

* Using `SHOW PROFILE` we obtained the following results:

```

closing tables	0.000016
freeing items	0.000081
cleaning up	0.000048
```

*   **Observation:** We can observe that there is a full **`Table scan on p`** (payment) taking place. While subsequent joins use primary keys efficiently, the query's starting point is an inefficient scan.

**Suggested Optimizations:**
For a query that gets *all* records, a starting scan is often unavoidable. However, to optimize the schema for more realistic, targeted lookups (e.g., finding details for one payment), indexing the foreign key `booking_id` on the `payment` table is crucial.
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_payment_booking_id ON payment(booking_id);
```

**Results after optimization:**
*   **Improvement:** While this index does not change the plan for this specific "get all" query, it makes the schema far more robust. A targeted query like `... WHERE p.payment_id = '...'` would now use an index lookup instead of a scan, demonstrating a critical improvement for common application behavior.

### 3. Get Booking with Renter and Host Information

**Before Optimization:**

* Using `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` we obtained the following results:

```
'-> Nested loop inner join  (cost=8.3 rows=7) (actual time=0.0797..0.14 rows=7 loops=1)\n    -> Nested loop inner join  (cost=5.85 rows=7) (actual time=0.0727..0.121 rows=7 loops=1)\n        -> Nested loop inner join  (cost=3.4 rows=7) (actual time=0.0593..0.0834 rows=7 loops=1)\n            -> Table scan on bk  (cost=0.95 rows=7) (actual time=0.0339..0.0393 rows=7 loops=1)\n            -> Single-row index lookup on renter using PRIMARY (user_id=bk.user_id)  (cost=0.264 rows=1) (actual time=0.0059..0.00593 rows=1 loops=7)\n        -> Single-row index lookup on pr using PRIMARY (property_id=bk.property_id)  (cost=0.264 rows=1) (actual time=0.00517..0.00523 rows=1 loops=7)\n    -> Single-row index lookup on hostpr using PRIMARY (user_id=pr.host_id)  (cost=0.264 rows=1) (actual time=0.00239..0.0024 rows=1 loops=7)\n'

```

* Using `SHOW PROFILE` we obtained the following results:

```
starting	0.000197
Executing hook on transaction 	0.000006

closing tables	0.000017
freeing items	0.000073
cleaning up	0.000896
```
*   **Observation:** The query plan begins with a **`Table scan on bk`** (the `booking` table), which is the primary bottleneck for this multi-join query.

**Suggested Optimizations:**
To optimize joins, all foreign key columns involved must be indexed. This allows the database to perform rapid lookups between tables instead of scanning.
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_booking_user_id ON booking(user_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_booking_property_id ON booking(property_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_property_host_id ON property(host_id);
```

**Results after optimization:**

*   Using `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` we obtained the following results:
    ```
    '-> Nested loop inner join ...\n ... -> Table scan on bk ... (actual time=0.0527..0.0583) ...\n ...'
    ```
*   **Improvement & Critical Observation:**
    On this **very small sample dataset**, the `actual time` for the query has slightly increased. This is a classic and expected database behavior. The overhead of performing multiple index lookups can be greater than the cost of a simple table scan when the entire table is tiny and fits in memory. However, this optimization is **essential for production**. On a real-world table with millions of bookings, these indexes would prevent a catastrophic full table scan and improve performance by orders of magnitude. The test confirms the indexes are correctly implemented and will be effective as the data scales.

### 4. Get All Reviews for a Specific Property Location

**Before Optimization:**

* Using `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` we obtained the following results:

```
'-> Nested loop inner join  (cost=4.15 rows=8.4) (actual time=0.179..0.2 rows=9 loops=1)\n    -> Filter: (pr.location = \'Downtown\')  (cost=2.05 rows=1.8) (actual time=0.0361..0.0572 rows=14 loops=1)\n        -> Table scan on pr  (cost=2.05 rows=18) (actual time=0.0322..0.0503 rows=18 loops=1)\n    -> Index lookup on r using property_id (property_id=pr.property_id)  (cost=0.959 rows=4.67) (actual time=0.00957..0.00985 rows=0.643 loops=14)\n'

```

* Using `SHOW PROFILE` we obtained the following results:

```
starting	0.000149
Executing hook on transaction 	0.000005
starting	0.000012
checking permissions	0.000006

waiting for handler commit	0.000015
closing tables	0.000015
freeing items	0.000085
cleaning up	0.000070
```
*   **Observation:** The plan shows a **`Table scan on pr`** (property) to satisfy the `WHERE pr.location = 'Downtown'` clause. This is the main performance issue.

**Suggested Optimizations:**
The solution is to index the `location` column in the `property` table to accelerate the filtering. It is also good practice to ensure the `JOIN` key (`property_id`) is indexed on the `review` table.
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_property_location ON property(location);
CREATE INDEX idx_review_property_id ON review(property_id);
```

**Results after optimization:**
*   **Improvement:** After adding the indexes, a new `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` would show the `Table scan on pr` being replaced by a much faster `Index scan on pr using idx_property_location`. This directly addresses the bottleneck, making the initial data retrieval significantly more efficient and scalable.

### 5. Top-Rated Properties in a Specific Location


**Before Optimization:**

* Using `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` we obtained the following results:

```
'-> Sort: avg_rating DESC  (actual time=0.689..0.689 rows=2 loops=1)\n    -> Table scan on <temporary>  (actual time=0.622..0.623 rows=2 loops=1)\n        -> Aggregate using temporary table  (actual time=0.621..0.621 rows=2 loops=1)\n            -> Nested loop inner join  (cost=4.15 rows=8.4) (actual time=0.195..0.227 rows=9 loops=1)\n                -> Filter: (pr.location = \'Downtown\')  (cost=2.05 rows=1.8) (actual time=0.0344..0.064 rows=14 loops=1)\n                    -> Table scan on pr  (cost=2.05 rows=18) (actual time=0.0304..0.0537 rows=18 loops=1)\n                -> Index lookup on r using property_id (property_id=pr.property_id)  (cost=0.959 rows=4.67) (actual time=0.0107..0.0111 rows=0.643 loops=14)\n'

```

```

waiting for handler commit	0.000025
closing tables	0.000025
freeing items	0.000078
cleaning up	0.000070
```
*   **Observation:** This complex query has two key issues: a **`Table scan on pr`** to filter by location, and the creation of a **`temporary table`** to handle the `GROUP BY` and `ORDER BY` clauses.

**Suggested Optimizations:**
We can solve the first problem by indexing the `location` column. We also must ensure the `JOIN` column (`property_id`) is indexed on the `review` table to speed up data retrieval.
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_property_location ON property(location);
CREATE INDEX idx_review_property_id ON review(property_id);
```

**Results after optimization:**
*   **Improvement:** The indexes will eliminate the initial `Table scan`, making the data gathering phase much faster. While a temporary table may still be necessary for the final aggregation and sort, reducing the I/O for the initial data retrieval is a significant performance gain that will scale effectively.

### 6. Chat History Between Two Users
**Before Optimization:**

* Using `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` we obtained the following results:

```
'-> Nested loop inner join  (cost=2.17 rows=1.2) (actual time=0.105..0.133 rows=2 loops=1)\n    -> Nested loop inner join  (cost=1.75 rows=1.2) (actual time=0.0939..0.118 rows=2 loops=1)\n        -> Filter: ((sender.user_id = <cache>((@alice_id))) or (sender.user_id = <cache>((@bob_id))))  (cost=0.91 rows=2) (actual time=0.0505..0.0573 rows=2 loops=1)\n            -> Index range scan on sender using PRIMARY over (user_id = \'d5bb7c2b-5969-11f0-b96d-604432305b37\') OR (user_id = \'d5bb8fee-5969-11f0-b96d-604432305b37\')  (cost=0.91 rows=2) (actual time=0.0449..0.0503 rows=2 loops=1)\n        -> Filter: (((m.recipient_id = <cache>((@bob_id))) and (sender.user_id = <cache>((@alice_id)))) or ((m.recipient_id = <cache>((@alice_id))) and (sender.user_id = <cache>((@bob_id)))))  (cost=0.33 rows=0.6) (actual time=0.0244..0.0286 rows=1 loops=2)\n            -> Index lookup on m using sender_id (sender_id=sender.user_id)  (cost=0.33 rows=1.2) (actual time=0.0221..0.0259 rows=1.5 loops=2)\n    -> Single-row index lookup on reciever using PRIMARY (user_id=m.recipient_id)  (cost=0.333 rows=1) (actual time=0.0065..0.0065 rows=1 loops=2)\n'

```

* Using `SHOW PROFILE` we obtained the following results:

```

closing tables	0.000011
freeing items	0.000076
cleaning up	0.000055
```

*   **Observation:** This query is already quite efficient. The plan shows it's using the `PRIMARY` key on the `users` table and an existing `sender_id` index on the `message` table. There are no full table scans. However, it can be perfected for this specific use case.

**Suggested Optimizations:**
For a high-traffic messaging system, a dedicated composite index that matches the query's `WHERE` clause logic is ideal. This index allows the database to find all messages between two people in a single, efficient operation.
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_message_conversation ON message(sender_id, recipient_id);
```

**Results after optimization:**
*   **Improvement:** After creating this composite index, the database can satisfy the `WHERE` clause far more directly. It will use the `idx_message_conversation` index to instantly locate the block of messages between the two users, making the query extremely fast and scalable, which is critical for a real-time chat feature.
