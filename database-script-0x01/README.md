## Overview of `schema.sql`

The schema models the following entities:

* **Users:** Guests, hosts, and admins, with authentication info and roles.
* **Properties:** Listings owned by hosts.
* **Bookings:** Reservations made by users for properties.
* **Payments:** Payment details for bookings.
* **Reviews:** User reviews of properties with ratings and comments.
* **Messages:** Communication between users.

---

## Features

* Uses `CHAR(36)` columns to store UUIDs as unique identifiers.
* Enforces data integrity with `PRIMARY KEY`, `FOREIGN KEY`, and `UNIQUE` constraints.
* Uses `ENUM` types for limited-value columns (e.g., user roles, booking status, payment methods).
* Timestamps with default current time and automatic update for modification tracking.
* Includes a `CHECK` constraint to ensure valid review ratings (1-5).

---

## Database

* **Target DBMS:** MySQL 8.x
* UUIDs are stored as 36-character strings generated by application or MySQLâ€™s `UUID()` function.
* Automatic timestamp updates for `updated_at` column in the `property` table via `ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`.

---

## Usage

Run the `schema.sql` script to create all tables and constraints:

```bash
mysql -u your_user -p your_database < schema.sql
```

* Ensure your application generates UUIDs in `CHAR(36)` format when inserting records.
* Use the schema as a base for building the AirBnB-like application backend.

---

## Notes

* Indexes are automatically created for primary keys, unique keys, and foreign keys.
* Additional indexes can be added on frequently queried columns if needed.
* Validation of UUID format and business logic should be handled at the application level.
