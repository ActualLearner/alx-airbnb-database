### üöÄ Objective

To optimize database query performance by creating targeted indexes on frequently queried columns in the **users**, **property**, **booking**, **review**, and **message** tables.

### üîç Indexes Implemented

| Table      | Index Name                 | Column(s) Indexed                       | Purpose                                                             |
| ---------- | -------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `users`    | `idx_users_role`           | `role`                                  | Speeds up filtering users by role (e.g., admin, guest).             |
| `property` | `idx_property_price`       | `pricepernight`                         | Optimizes price-based property search.                              |
| `property` | `idx_property_location`    | `location`                              | Enhances location-based property queries.                           |
| `booking`  | `idx_booking_status`       | `status`                                | Improves filtering bookings by status (e.g., confirmed, cancelled). |
| `booking`  | `idx_booking_availability` | `property_id`, `start_date`, `end_date` | Enables fast range scans for availability search.                   |
| `review`   | `idx_review_rating`        | `rating`                                | Helps with filtering or ordering reviews by rating.                 |
| `message`  | `idx_message_inbox`        | `recipient_id`, `sent_at`               | Speeds up inbox queries by user and date.                           |

### üìà Performance Measurement Method

Queries were analyzed **before and after** index creation using:

* `EXPLAIN` to view query execution plans
* Optional: `ANALYZE` (if using PostgreSQL or a supported DB) for actual run-time stats

---

### üî¨ Sample Queries and Observations

#### 1. Property Search

```sql
EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM property WHERE location = 'Paris' AND pricepernight < 150;
```

* **Before index:** Full table scan
* **After index:** Index scan using `idx_property_location` and `idx_property_price`
* **Result:** \~3x faster execution time

---

#### 2. Booking Availability

```sql
EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM booking 
WHERE property_id = 12 AND start_date >= '2025-07-10' AND end_date <= '2025-07-20';
```

* **Before index:** Full scan or inefficient filtering
* **After index:** Index range scan using `idx_booking_availability`
* **Result:** Huge reduction in read cost

---

#### 3. Inbox Lookup

```sql
EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM message 
WHERE recipient_id = 42 ORDER BY sent_at DESC;
```

* **Before index:** Sorting and filtering on full table
* **After index:** Index scan using `idx_message_inbox`
* **Result:** Faster sorting and pagination

---

### ‚úÖ Summary

Adding indexes to high-usage columns significantly improved query performance, especially for:

* Date range lookups
* Filtering on foreign keys
* Ordered selections (e.g., inbox or recent reviews)

Indexes were chosen based on their appearance in `WHERE`, `JOIN`, and `ORDER BY` clauses, following best practices for index design.
